Answers for different systems are in their corresponding folders.
To run the system simply run:
Locally: 
```
make run
```
OR

On docker: 
```
make up
```
inside the corresponding folder for the system.

The parameters of the System can be changed form the System*.ex file in the lib folder for that system.
